### INTRODUCTION
Plant identification is the process of comparing features of a plant to previously collected and categorized specimens.
This process helps connect the specimen with a particular species, which lets one recognize the specimen’s proper-ties. 
The method of plant identification is instrumental to plant taxonomy, and botanical nomenclature. A faster,
automated, and more reliable method of plant species iden-tification would be helpful in phytological research.
Deep learning (DL) is a subset of machine learning meth-ods. DL algorithms are inspired by biological neurons’ struc-ture and function.
DL uses multiple layers of information processing to build abstractions of data, from which features can be extracted and patterns classified. 
One of the widely used algorithms in DL is the convolutional neural network (CNN), which is extensively used for image classification. We are using resnext101_32x4d_ssl model 
which comes under R-CNN model this will extract and use the features of the image to predict the image we upload.
